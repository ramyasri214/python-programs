# task:
# Practice conditional statements
# Conditional statements:-conditional statements are used to take decisions
# the following are the different types of conditional statements:
# 1)if:-if condition is true then print the statements
# example program:-
# a=30
# b=20
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# 2)if-else:-if condition is true then return if statements if the condition is false then return else statements
# example program:-
# a=20
# b=30
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#     print("a is less than b")
# 3)nested-if:- one if statement inside another if statement
# a=20
# b=40
# c=70
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greater than b")
#     if a>c:
#         print("a is greater than b")
#     else:
#         print("b is greater than a")
# else:
#     print("b is less than c")
# # 4)switch:-
# fruits='banana'
# if fruits=='appple':
#     print("this is apple")
# elif fruits=='banana':
#     print("this is banana")
# elif fruits=='grapes':
#     print("this is grapers")
# else:
#     print("none of the above")
# 5)elif:-we can write more if statements by using elif condition
# color='pink'
# if color=='pink':
#     print("this is pink color")
# elif color=='red':
#     print("this is red color")
# elif color=='blue':
#     print("this is blue color")
# else:
#     print("none of the above")
